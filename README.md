# Joystick 

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to monitor joystick inputs using analog readings from the X and Y axes. Based on predefined threshold values, the program detects commands for left, right, up, and down movements of the joystick.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Board**
2. **Joystick Module**
3. **Jumper Wires**

### Block diagram


#### Instructions

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the joystick module to the Arduino board using jumper wires.
   - Ensure the connections are correctly made, with the X axis connected to pin A0 and the Y axis connected to pin A1.

2. **Read Joystick Inputs:**
   - Continuously read the analog values from the X and Y axes of the joystick module.

3. **Detect Movement Commands:**
   - Compare the analog values to predefined threshold values to determine joystick movements.
   - If the value falls below the left threshold, it indicates a left movement command. If it exceeds the right threshold, it indicates a right movement command.
   - Similarly, for the Y axis, values below the up threshold indicate an up movement command, and values above the down threshold indicate a down movement command.

4. **Print Detected Commands:**
   - Print the detected commands to the Serial Monitor based on joystick movements.

#### Applications

- **Game Controllers:** Use joystick inputs for controlling characters or objects in gaming applications.
- **Remote Control Systems:** Implement joystick-based remote control systems for various devices.
- **Robotic Applications:** Control the movement of robotic arms or vehicles using joystick inputs.

#### Notes

- Adjust threshold values according to the sensitivity of the joystick and the desired responsiveness of the system.
